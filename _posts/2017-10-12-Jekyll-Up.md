### **Hi!**

My name is Arslan Kazmi. This is my second attempt at a personal website. Let me tell you why I chose Github Pages, and how I set it up.

# The Problem

I needed a free, simple static site hosting method to start my online "presence", as it were. My first attempt was on WordPress. 

It didn't go so well. 

WordPress was a way more powerful tool than what I needed. I just wanted to have a way to host and easily update a simple blog, while WordPress was ready to make me a gigantic behemoth version of one. And yes, I know that you can create a simple site too, but it was just that the huge number of options confused me : Did I want the blue theme or the pretty flowery one? Did I want a search bar? It drew me crazy enough that I left it alone for a while.

Then recently I came across Github Pages. Github Pages runs on Jekyll, a static site generator. I just had to create a repository called <username>.github.io to host a site at https://<username>.github.io. It was that simple. Except that then I needed to go to Jekyll's site and learn how to create a Jekyll site. Either I could manually create all the files and directories online in Github itself, or I could install Ruby and Jekyll locally, create a site, link it to my Github repo and use the classic push method to upload/sync with the actual online repository. Both methods seemed even <b><i>more</i></b> time consuming, and I wanted to to a maximum, if not all, actual work online.
  
# The Solution

After searching some more, I came across this repo : [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It contained a bare-bones fully working Jekyll site template, compatible with Github Pages to boot! All I had to do was fork it, and rename the forked repository to <username>.github.io. So simple! So I said farewell to my first ".github.io" repo, forked jekyll-now, renamed it and viola! A fully working simple website/blog!
  
# The Post Processing
 
 One thing was still irking me. Because I had forked the original repo, my own repo was forever linked to the original, with all its commits,merges and whatnot. I wanted to completely sever ties with my parent, to be free and have the only collaborator be me, nobody else. So after some more yahooing and goggling I found a way to do so. I renamed the repo again, chose "import repository" from Github's menu, entered the renamed repo's git link, and named the resulting repo, you guessed it, <username>.github.io. And finally I had my own, no-strings-attached personal repo, with my own personal site.
  
 I just had to personalize the given templates, and add markdown posts to my "_posts" folder. 
 
<i>So I wrote this post</i>.
 
#### The End.
  
PS : Some Markdown testing: 

>The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
